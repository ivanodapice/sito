title: "Write a program in C++ coding language that simulate the periodic acquisition by sensors (In a specific Museum's Room) of a certain number of temperature measures. Those measures must be set randomly in a range of one to fifty. The number of sensors that acquires temperature also must be set randomly but in a range of 1 to 10 pieces. Once we get those measurements of temperature the program must calculate the value of minimum, maximum and the average of our temperature values. With the average value of the temperature, if we get a lower value of 10 or a higher value of 28 Celsius degrees the program must alert to turn on the air conditioning by a message of video output."

/*Changelog :
 Version 1.0 - Got some bugs... the temperature shows always the same value with Generate()
 structure, and my reiteration process doesn't work with char consent
 ---Solved (changed random numbers process for the vector and also changed consent type from
 char to string)
 
 Version 2.0 - Program works correctly now.
